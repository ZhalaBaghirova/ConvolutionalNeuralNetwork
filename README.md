# ML- CNN 
Machine Learning - Convolutional Neural Network.
In this project, we created a model for identifying viscosity of different 
liquids. Our data is the images of liquid drops in different time lapses. These 
images were taken from the video of the droplets dropping from a syringe pump. 
Our goal is to extract the features of liquids from images and make a model for 
making predictions of viscosity. Extracted features were used as an input for an 
Convolutional Neural Network model.
